# Student Course and Grade Management Application

## Overview

This application is designed to manage student courses and grades through a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to view student details, including courses enrolled and grades received. Additionally, it provides the functionality to update student grades. The application interacts with a Microsoft Access database to retrieve and update information.

## Features

- **Database Connectivity**: Connects to a Microsoft Access database to fetch and update student information.
- **View Student Information**: Displays a list of students, their enrolled courses, and current grades.
- **Update Grades**: Allows the user to update the grades for any course enrolled by a student.
- **Grade Enumeration**: Utilizes an enumeration for grades to standardize grade values within the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Microsoft Access or a compatible DBMS installed, with the database file setup as per the application's requirements.

### Database Setup

Ensure your database contains the necessary tables for storing student information, courses, and grades. The application expects a `Studentcourse.accdb` database with appropriate schema for students, courses, and grades.
